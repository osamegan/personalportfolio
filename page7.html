      <h1 style="color: white;"> Art </h1>
    <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+2"> Throughout this year I have used art in multiple projects. The main one was when we had to make a diorama based off the interactive story we were making.
        My first set of partners I painted a shoebox to give off a creepy graveyard feel the added some fake little trees, a metal house, and some small skeleton bones.
        We had to get creative because we wanted things to be proportional but also to where you could understand what the scene was. Then with my second partner she baked most of the items we put in the diorama.
