      <h1> Project Overview </h1>
    <p> <font size="+1"> You will get to look into four of the main prjects I have done. The first is a game I created with a partner called Chess.io. The next 
        is an Interactive story I made, the third will be a calculator. Last but not least, is a program made for a website called Advent of Code. Each came with their own challenges that were difficult to get through
        but with perseverance and help from my amazing teacher I was capable of overcoming them.
