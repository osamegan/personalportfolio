      <h1 style="color: white;"> Project Overview </h1>
    <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> You will get to look into four of the main prjects I have done. The first is a game I created with a partner called Chess.io. The next 
        is an Interactive story I made, the third will be a calculator. Last but not least, is a program made for a website called Advent of Code. Each came with their own challenges that were difficult to get through
        but with perseverance and help from my amazing teacher I was capable of overcoming them.
       </font></p>
       <p style="color: white;"><font size="+1">  My first project is Chess.io. We were assigned this project for an event called C.A.R.T. showcase. You get to present your creation to the 
         whole school and if chosen, you show it to the school board. This year we were partnered up and told to make an electronic version of a board game 
         and to change it a bit to make it your own. My partner and I chose to make our own version of chess. In our version there were 4 players rather than two and 
         we only used some of the pieces there are in chess. Each player had two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and one king. 
         Another thing we changed is the pieces, rather than the bland regular chess pieces we used Pac Man characters. 
         The objective of the game was to take out other players and fill the board with your color. You would have a line of color follow you 
         and to fill the board you would have to close off the lines. It was so much fun to make and see the end product and I also had a wonderful partner
          so this is my favorite project I have created.
       </p>
       <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> The second project is an Interactive story I created. Our assignment was to get in groups and choose one person's short story they wrote and turn it into a choose you 
         own path story. Next we had to code it to work on the computer. Along with it we had to make a diorama of one of the scenes and present it all together.
          I ended up coding mine alone due to my partner leaving but it was still just as enjoyable.

       <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> My next project is a calculator we made. We had to make a site that asked you to put in any numbers you pleased along with a math symbol. 
         Our program was supposed to correctly answer the question.
       </p>
       
       <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> The last project was for a website called Advent of Code. It gave you a task to crack a code. My task was to find the answer 
         to an extremely long list of numbers that either added or subtracted from eachother. This was my first challenging program I had done.
