      <h1 style="color: white;"> Writing </h1>
    <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> Throughout this year we have done quite a bit of writing assignments. Some of my personal favorites would have to be 
        when we wrote our oen stories as well as our own endings to a story called "The Veldt". The story I wrote was about a girl who could die but come back to life. The only thing is she felt the pain still. One day, she doesn't 
        feel the pain and a lot begins to happen. Then, in my ending of "the Veldt" ratehr than the parents being mauled by lions, I change it to they ran out of the room 
        and realized the lions were real, not just in the walls but outside of them. The parents are scared because the animals are trying to get out of the room but they are not successful so far.
