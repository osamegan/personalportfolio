  <p style="text-align: center;color:hotpink;font-size:40px;"><em> My stories </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;color:black;font-size:20px;">Throughout this year we have done quite a bit 
    <br>of writing assignments. Some of my personal favorites would have to be when we wrote our own stories 
    <br>as well as our own endings to a story called "The Veldt". The story I wrote was about a girl who could 
    <br>die but come back to life. The only thing is she felt the pain still. One day, she doesn't feel the pain 
    <br>and a lot begins to happen. Then, in my ending of "the Veldt" rather than the parents being mauled by 
    <br>lions, I changed it to they ran out of the room and realized the lions were real, not just in the walls 
    <br>but outside of them. The parents are scared because the animals are trying to get out of the room but 
    <br>they are not successful so far.

      <br>He sits down to join them on the floor and they offer him a sandwich. He goes to take a bite, but something 
      <br>doesn’t feel right. He asks once again where the childrens’ parents are. They respond that they are in the 
      <br>room with them. Mr. Mclean doesn’t understand but then sees the lions walk past them with Lydia’s scarf 
      <br>and George’s wallet in their mouths’. The kids ask if he enjoys the sandwich and say they used a new meat. 
      <br>Mr. Mclean’s face turns white as he realizes what the meat is. He tells the kids he is going to use the 
      <br>washroom and calls security. After a while they get there, they step into the house and hear children 
      <br>screaming help. They run to the nursery to find Mr. Mclean torn to pieces by what seemed to be the lions. 
      <br>The security takes the kids to a foster home and it is never known what truly happened to Mr. Mclean and 
      <br>the kids’ parents.

    <p style="text-align: center;color:black;font-size:20px;">There once was a girl who you 
      <br>could swear on your life was made of stardust and ash. Her name was Sally. As dark 
      <br>as her soul and mind was, there wasn’t another girl you’d meet that was as sweet and 
      <br>loving as her. She laid in a field with flowers streaming through her long, beautiful 
      <br>pale blue hair. She watched as the sun was at one end of the sky and stars were arising 
      <br>in the other. The soft wind blew her hair into her solid black eyes. Stitches covered 
      <br>her body like she’d been taken apart and put back together. She was dark and evil like 
      <br>a witch but beautiful as an angel. Her doll-like dress was spread out on the ground and 
      <br>slightly waved in the wind. As peaceful as she was, she heard screams and suddenly there 
      <br>was a dark figure standing above her. When she was a little girl her mother and father 
      <br>had always fought and they’d blame her for everything and beat her for it. She also had 
      <br>always been bullied and beaten at school as well. Her only escape was her world, which 
      <br>was why she now went there so often ever since she realized she could. People called her 
      <br>crazy for it but after a while she ignored it because it made her happy. Sally didn’t want 
      <br>to leave. Everybody told her how bad her “world” was but it was better than the one they wanted 
      <br>her in. Her world, although odd and dark, was nice to her and made her happy. Her world wasn’t 
      <br>perfect either though. She’d die and come back to life but still feel the pain. Until one day 
      <br>she didn’t feel it, she didn’t mind in fact, she thought it was cool. Not too long after leaving 
      <br>her world her brother got run over. It was sad but what was odd was that there was no evidence or 
      <br>witnesses. It happened right in front of their house and they lived on the busiest street in NYC. 
      <br>Sally didn’t make any connections until a week later. She realized that just before her brother got 
      <br>“hit”, she had just run over herself and that was the first time she “died” without feeling the pain. 
      <br>Sally dismissed it and told herself it wasn’t her fault. Time went by but the family was still 
      <br>grieving, well most of it at least. Sally moved on frighteningly quickly and went back to her 
      <br>world. Suddenly, they reminded her of the horrible thing she had done bringing her to hang herself. 
      <br>Once again, she felt no pain and came back perfectly fine. She decided not to leave so she didn’t 
      <br>have to be around all the moping people. Her friends took her to a carnival and they had lots of 
      <br>fun. Soon what happened escaped her mind and she was back to normal. Finally, she decided to come 
      <br>back to her world and she realized nobody was home, which was unusual because there was always 
      <br>somebody home. She started calling her family and found out her mother had been hung. Sally didn't 
      <br>know what to do anymore but knew why these things were happening and was uncertain if she would be 
      <br>caught or not. A month had passed since she last visited her world and finally decided to go back. 
      <br>She wanted to die again but is scared of who will be affected. Sally decided that she didn’t care 
      <br>and stabbed herself. Just as expected, she came back to the real world and her father had been 
      <br>stabbed. Now the police were really suspicious and they knew they couldn’t just give up on this 
      <br>case. The police forced Sally and her older sister, who was 27, to go live with their grandparents. 
      <br>The police still couldn’t find any suspects, leads, or evidence and were now desperate and on edge. 
      <br>Although Sally felt scared and a little guilty she decided it’s best to just stay quiet. She stopped 
      <br>going to her world for a little while and had to go back to school. She was a junior in high school 
      <br>but had no real friends, just lots and lots of acquaintances. One Tuesday morning she decided to 
      <br>walk home rather than drive and ended up meeting a new friend, her name was Emily. Emily was tall 
      <br>and slender like Sally but had beautiful long red hair. Her skin was open permanently and bared her 
      <br>bones to the outside world. For this she too had been bullied and called a freak growing up. Emily 
      <br>was never beaten but was almost murdered multiple times and that led her to depression and suicide. 
      <br>That was when she found out about her capability. She really liked that she could fulfill her suicide 
      <br>craves without actually dying but still being able to feel the pain. Emily was addicted to the pain 
      <br>and everyone thought that was so gross and weird yet she loved it. She soon learns, through lots 
      <br>of talking, that this girl was just like her! The girls both have the ability to kill themselves 
      <br>in their worlds and feel no pain but cause others to die when they do that. Although most would 
      <br>think that was evil and wrong, it’s what helped them keep their sanity after everything they’ve 
      <br>been through. Sally and Emily find out that they are both responsible for multiple cold cases and 
      <br>finally feel like they have a safe place. They wanted to make a tradition and chose to wear all 
      <br>black every Wednesday. Her and her new friend realized that they had been through too much and people
      <br> deserved to know how they made them feel. Sally and Emily met up and combined their worlds by communicating. 
      <br>“Are you here?” asked Emily. “Yes. I’m right down the street, I see you!” exclaimed Sally. “Are you ready?” 
      <br>asked Emily. “Of course,” replied Sally. They killed themselves over and over for hours on end. They decided 
      <br>to stop for a bit and go back to see the damage they’d done. The girls came back to a ghost town and were 
      <br>actually very happy with what they’d done. No longer feeling guilty for anything, the girls moved on to the 
      <br>next town, leaving a couple of people in each place. Nobody ever could figure out how this was happening and 
      <br>every single death became a cold case. So many were left devastated and drowned in grief and loneliness. 
      <br>Sally and Emily proved to everyone that if they don’t want darkness to come then they shouldn’t spread it. 
      <br>You never know how you’re affecting others with the things you do.
