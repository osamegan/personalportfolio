    <p> <font size="+1"> Project 1
       </font></p>
      <p2> <font size="+0">  The software I used was Visual Studio Code and the language was CSS and JavaScript. 
        Some challenges my partner and I faced during this project mainly had to do with getting everything working as well as looking good.
        The first challenge we faced was getting the whole thing to work. We had it looking ok but it didn't function the way we were trying to make it function.
        The next challenge was putting pictures into the program. Our pieces were pac men characters and to make the pieces look the way we want and 
        work was very difficult. Along with all of this we had to make it work and look great by the due date which was very difficulting. The C.A.R.T. "Habits of Mind" we used were mostly collaboration and communication.
        To effectively get it done in time and collaborate well we had to have good communication and be able to work together very well. A concept I learned was that you can never really be done. There is always something else
        you can improve on or fix.

      <p3> <font size="+1"> Project 2
      </font></p3>
      <p4> <font size="+0"> In this project I also used Visual Studio Code and the language I used was JavaScript. Challenges I faced during this project 
        was ending up with no partners to help with the project and working alone. My first set of partners didn't want to do much and expected me to code most. We also had opposing ideas and it made it very difficult for us to work together so I got a new partner.
        My next partner ended up leaving the school leaving me to work on the project alone. One of the "Habits of Mind" I used was hard work and persistence.
        I had to continue to work hard as I adjusted to the changes as well as be persistent and not give up when I was working alone. A concept I learned while working on this project was that no 
        matter what happens I had to keep going even though I was on my own.

      <p5> <font size="+1"> Project 3
      </font></p5>
      <p6> <font size="+0"> I used Visual Studio Code and JavaScript as my language. Throughout this project I had to overcome challenges like making it correctly calculate equations
        as well as understand different things they'd input to represent the symbols. "Habits of Mind" I used was just to not give up because although 
        there were many different things I had to think about. A concept I learned in this project was to be open minded and think aout what others may put in the calculator not just what I'd put.

      <p7> <font size="+1"> Project 4
      </font></p7>
      <p8> <font size="+0"> Once again I used Visual Studio Code for my software and Javascript for my language. I had trouble understanding how to go about coding a program that 
        did what they asked. This was also my first time doing a semi-hard program. Along with the process of completing this I was constantly getting
        frustrated because I didn't really know what to do so I had to be patient and tell myself to keep trying. A "Habit of Mind" I once again used was
        persistence to encourage myself to not give up even though it was difficult. A concept I learned in this was that it is ok to ask for help and receive it. I would constantly look at help as cheating and this
        helped me realize that asking for help with code does not mean you're cheating.
