    <p style="text-align: center;color:black;font-size:25px;">The software I used was Visual Studio Code and 
      <br>the language was CSS and JavaScript. Some challenges my partner and I faced during this project mainly 
      <br>had to do with getting everything working as well as looking good. The first challenge we faced was 
      <br>getting the whole thing to work. We had it looking ok but it didn't function the way we were trying 
      <br>to make it function. The next challenge was putting pictures into the program. Our pieces were Pac 
      <br>Man characters and to make the pieces look the way we want and work was very difficult. Along with 
      <br>all of this we had to make it work and look great by the due date which was very difficulting. The 
      <br>C.A.R.T. "Habits of Mind" we used were mostly collaboration and communication.To effectively get 
      <br>it done in time and collaborate well we had to have good communication and be able to work together 
      <br>very well. A concept I learned was that you can never really be done. There is always something else
      <br>you can improve on or fix.

    <p style="text-align: center;color:black;font-size:25px;">In this project I also used Visual Studio Code
      <br> and the language I used was JavaScript. Challenges I faced during this project was ending up with 
      <br>no partners to help with the project and working alone. My first set of partners didn't want to do 
      <br>much and expected me to code most. We also had opposing ideas and it made it very difficult for us 
      <br>to work together so I got a new partner.My next partner ended up leaving the school leaving me to 
      <br>work on the project alone. One of the "Habits of Mind" I used was hard work and persistence. I had
      <br>to continue to work hard as I adjusted to the changes as well as be persistent and not give up when 
      <br>I was working alone. A concept I learned while working on this project was that no matter what happens 
      <br>I had to keep going even though I was on my own.

      <p style="text-align: center;color:black;font-size:25px;">I used Visual Studio Code and JavaScript 
        <br>as my language. Throughout this project I had to overcome challenges like making it correctly 
        <br>calculate equations as well as understand different things they'd input to represent the symbols. 
        <br>"Habits of Mind" I used was just to not give up because although there were many different things 
        <br>I had to think about. A concept I learned in this project was to be open minded and think about what 
        <br>others may put in the calculator not just what I'd put.

      <div class="w3-row">
        <h6 style="text-align: center;color:rgb(255, 217, 0);font-size:50px;"> P R O J E C T</h6>
        <h6 style="text-align: center;color:rgb(255, 217, 0);font-size:50px;"> 0 4</h6>
        <p style="text-align: center;color:black;font-size:25px;">Once again I used Visual Studio Code 
          <br>for my software and Javascript for my language. I had trouble understanding how to go about 
          <br>coding a program that did what they asked. This was also my first time doing a semi-hard 
          <br>program. Along with the process of completing this I was constantly getting frustrated because 
          <br>I didn't really know what to do so I had to be patient and tell myself to keep trying. A "Habit 
          <br>of Mind" I once again used was persistence to encourage myself to not give up even though 
          <br>it was difficult. A concept I learned in this was that it is ok to ask for help and receive 
          <br>it. I would constantly look at help as cheating and this helped me realize that asking for 
          <br>help with code does not mean you're cheating.
