      <h1>Welcome </h1>
    <p style="color: khaki;"> <font size="+2">Hello! My name is Megan Schroeder. I am going into my senior year of high school. I was apart of the Web Development program at C.A.R.T. 
      Although I enjoy programming greatly, I plan to study buisness in college. I hope to study fashion merchandising and
      eventually work for a popular fashion company. My dream
      place to work would be at Chanel in Paris.
      I have worked on many projects throughout my time at C.A.R.T. which you will learn more about.
       </font></p>
       <p2 style="color: khaki;"> <font size="+2"> These projects consist of a game, interactive story, and much more. Although they were each challenging they were 
           also so much fun to complete and make.
       </font></p2>
