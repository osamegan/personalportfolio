      <h1>Welcome </h1>
    <p> <font size="+2"> Hello! My name is Megan Schroeder. I am going into my senior year of high school. I was apart of the Web Development program at C.A.R.T. 
      Although I enjoy programming greatly, I plan to study buisness in college.
      I have worked on many projects throughout my time at C.A.R.T. which you will learn more about.
       </font></p>
       <p2> <font size="+1"> These projects consist of a game, interactive story, and much more.
