      <h1 style="color: white;"> About me! </h1>
    <p style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> While at C.A.R.T., my partner and I got the opportunity to be finalists in showcase and present a game we made. Although
        we did not win any of the top three prizes, we still got the honor to present as finalists. Some other awards I have received was an
        award from my JROTC program for the rank of airmen first class. 
       </font></p>
       <p2 style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> I have many hobbies, depending on how I feel they can change very quickly. My main ones would be reading, drawing, and listening to music
           I have always loved to learn new things, so typically I will read about things I want to learn or look in to.
       </font></p2>
       <p3 style="color: white;"> <font size="+1"> My four year plan is not very complex. I will graduate in the year 2021 and head to college to study business. I also hope to be apart of one of the many
           soroities thorughout the schools. Then by my fourth year of college I hope to graduate top of my class and find a good job. After that, I plan to begin working on my Master's degree. My end goal is getting my doctorate in business
